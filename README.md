# Next.js 15 Server Component: Silent Data Fetch Errors in Nested Asynchronous Operations

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js 15 server components when dealing with deeply nested asynchronous data fetching.  The problem arises from the fact that errors during nested API calls might not be correctly propagated, leading to silent failures or unexpected rendering.

## Bug Description
When using server components with multiple dependent API calls, an error in one of the inner calls may not result in an appropriate error message or fallback. The component might render partially or incorrectly, without providing any indication of the failure.

## Reproduction
The `bug.js` file contains a server component with nested API calls. Try running it and trigger an error in one of the data fetching functions. The component won't handle the error gracefully.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a robust solution involving comprehensive error handling at each step of the asynchronous operation, ensuring that any error is properly caught and handled, preventing silent failures.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the components in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` to see the difference in error handling.
